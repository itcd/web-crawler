# web-crawler
## A simple web spider with Scrapy and Python 3
Note the ordered mode, which yields requests one at a time, is slower than the unordered mode.

### Prerequisite
Python 3  
scrapy  
unidecode  

### Installation
Install Anaconda with Python 3 and install the Python packages via the conda command.  
conda install scrapy -c conda-forge  
conda install unidecode  

### A potential problem on Windows
Some people might encounter the following problem on Windows.  
ImportError: DLL load failed: The operating system cannot run %1.  

Reinstalling cryptography may solve the problem.  
pip uninstall cryptography  
pip install cryptography  

### Usage
Go to the Scrapy projectâ€™s top level directory (where scrapy.cfg is) and run the batch files in the Anaconda Prompt.
